# Basic Search Algorithms for graphs

Within this repo you will find several graph related algorithms like breadth first search, depth first search or djikstras algorithm.

You will find some applications of these algorithms as well, for example to count the number of islands within a graph or to find the largest or smallest island within a graph. (Island = connected nodes)
