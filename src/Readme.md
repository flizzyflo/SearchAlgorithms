## Table of content
This program visualizes several search- and pathfinding algorithms.
One has to set up start- and endpoint within the user interface. 
If desired, wall as obstacles can be added as well. The user can select out
of several algorithms. Algorithms itself are divided in two categories: 
search- and pathfinding algorithms.
Search algorithms just check whether a path exists or not. Pathfinding algorithms 
present the shortest path (given an existing path) between start and end node.
